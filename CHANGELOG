The wiring inside the wooden node box next to the workbench Mega
09-17-16  I rebuilt the data line to pin six for the PWM lighting experiments.  A purple dupont connection on the Mega to 
to striped blue to yellow lead of 5 wire tstat cable
the yellow wire then goes to the wooden fuse box above the doorway (fuses e - h .) and connects to the whiteorange wire of the 12wire gray data cable.
the whiteorange wire then goes to the power source switch box where it connects to the gate wire of the MOSFET circuit.

 Begining the rewrite of "Workbench_Mega"

11.27.2017
Repaired Main Loop to allow for rollover safe function for my500msLoopfunction()
Added voltage averaging in fast main loop part of program.  Calibrated voltage.

11.28.2017
Adding voltage compensation code to the track light dimmer.  I want to prevent those lights
from exceeding 12vdc.  I think the high charging rail voltage is damaging the bulbs.

11.30.2017
I am changing the way the RTC clock is read and used to end dependence on constant updates.

12.1.2017
I created (tmElements_t  current_microcontroller_time) and I am updating it every second.
This will replace all the calls to the external clock for the functions that still rely on
the current long time format.

12.2.2017
I timed the difference in the clock on the Arduino Mega against the RTC module.  The Arduino
was almost 36 seconds slower after only 6 hours!  I had the idea to update the clock at midnight,
but I guess I'll have to update every second.

12.3.2017
I made repairs to the message manager function.  It needed independent timing.  It still needs
attention

12.4.2017
I finished wiring up the AUX power wiring.  Begining a new function myAuxPowerfunction()and
myTestForMorningBatteryChargefunction()

12.5.2017
Improvements to sunrise / sunset variables

1.5.2018
New batteries!  4 x 100AH

BATTERY BENCHMARKS
START 13.3V  9:41 315WATTS OUT 84 IN 9:43 DROPPED TO 12.4 PRETTY QUICKLY, faster than i expected

1.6.2018
9:54:00 TO 9:55:30 READ 12.4 AT MONITOR, THEY JUMPED BACK TO 12.7, THEN .8 PRetty quickly mebbe 400 watts 

2.16.2018
I'm working on a two stage circuit swapping system for breakers 4 and 8 here in the workshop.


2.26.2018
I want to restructure the modes to make linear sense
mode 0 sleep =  aux power on
mode 1 wake  =  aux power off for x minutes to let batteries settle
idea:  a function that takes these parameters (min/max voltage allowable time min/max) 
       from one of the mode routines, and returns a number when the condition has been met.


5.1.2018 first object written!  MyTimer

5.8.2018 Trying to implement a "state machine"
5.11.2018  Success!  a machine with 16 states of being.  I'll be able to cut out a whole lot of
           spaghetti code now.
           
03-11-19 created GitLab Repository.  I had trouble with my daylight savings time change this year.  I will now
    apply my new knowledge of C++ to refactor this code.
03-11-19-10:28 create changelog, added update script
03-11-19-11:02 combined old project files
03-11-19-11:17 moving workbench_lighting_MOSFET_signal_pin to pin 10 due to a broken pin in the Arduino Mega pin 6 slot
03-11-19-11:23 moving battery_charger_signal_pin from pin 4 to pin 11 to address a possible bad transitor
03-11-19-11:53 myTimer initial refactor
03-11-19-12:01 localize time library
03-11-19-12:03 added library files
03-12-19-10:24 repaired *char warnings and created MyLCD class
03-12-19-10:55 added Jons birthday
03-12-19-11:00 add class MyStateMachine and class MyImportantDates
03-12-19-12:38 initialization list experiment
03-12-19-18:26 removed library version numbers from folders for compatibility with Linux Arduino
03-12-19-18:55 rebuilt important dates array
